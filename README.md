## Fantocci

This is a personal fork of Godot 2.1. It is undocumented, unsupported and
possibly broken. It is published mainly as a redundancy backup and for
personal convenience.

It is not forked from <https://github.com/godotengine/godot> so I can have a
smaller repository to handle and to make clear that keeping compatibility with
Godot, or with previous commits for that matter, is not a priority.

If anything stable enough and compatible enough is to be found here, it is
likely to show up in <https://github.com/efornara/godot/tree/rpi-dev>
eventually.

New files are released, just like Godot, under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).

Godot's [README.md](GODOT_README.md) and [LICENSE.txt](GODOT_LICENSE.txt) are
still available here, but for the history of Godot 2.1.6-stable, please see:
<https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commits/2.1.6-stable>.
